    <h1><a name="2up">Two Up</a></h1>

    <div class="navbar">
      <a href="galley.html">Previous Page</a>
      &bull;

    </div>

    <p>There are occasions when you might want to print more than one page
      of a PostScript document on a piece of paper. For example, you may have
      a collection of slides for a presentation, and you may want to print them
      out in condensed form for a kind of digest hand-out. This kind of printing,
      where two pages are printed side-by-side on a piece of paper is called
      &ldquo;two-up,&rdquo; for the two pages facing up. This idea generalizes
      readily to any number of pages (though, of course, legibility goes down
      quickly as the number of pages goes up). In its general form, it is called
      &ldquo;n-up.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2><a name="postscript">The PostScript</a></h2>

    <p>What is necessary to print in two-up mode? First, we need
      to translate and rotate each page into the right location of the page,
      then we need to make sure that the page fits in the new area reserved for
      it (we will need to scale it down to about half its original size). If
      we place the two pages side by side, we will get proper two-up form.</p>

    <p>The code I will present here will place the odd pages on the left (as
      you&rsquo;re looking at the page in landscape orientation) and the even pages on
      the right. You could do it the other way around, if that makes more sense
      to you.</p>

    <p>Here is the code we must wrap around the odd pages:</p>

<pre>
        gsave
         504 30 translate  % Position page in middle of region
         90 rotate         % Aim it in the right direction
         .5 .5 scale       % make it small enough
         % original page code here...
        grestore
</pre>

    <p>And here is the code for the even pages:</p>

<pre>
        gsave
         504 426 translate % Position page in middle of region
         90 rotate         % Aim it in the right direction
         .5 .5 scale       % make it small enough
         % original page code here...
        grestore
</pre>

    <p>Now, you will notice that I used some curious numbers in the <a href="operators.html#translate">translate</a>
      command. The reason I chose these particular numbers was that I wanted
      to center each page in its half of the page. I knew I was going to scale
      by 0.5, so I computed how much white-space was left and added in the appropriate
      fudge-factor to center the pages.</p>
    
    <p>You may also notice that I wrap a <a href="opeators.html#gsave">gsave</a>
      and a <a href="operators.html#grestore">grestore</a> around the page and
      the additional code? The reason for this is that each page <em>must</em>
      leave the state of the printer unchanged when it has been printed. If you
      permanently change the state, that state change will be in affect for all
      subsequent pages. By following this rule, you make the pages independent
      of order. Some print servers must shuffle page order in order to print
      the document correctly; since my pages are independent (at least as far
      as my code is concerned), they will print correctly.</p>

    <h2><a name="hard">The Hard Part</a></h2>
    
    <p>Now comes the hard part of recognizing where the pages begin. The technique
      is essentially the same as what we used for <a href="galley.html#hard">galley
	proofs</a>, so I will spare you the logic here. Essentially, we will look
      for <b>%%Page:</b> comments. We will, however, need to keep track of whether
      the current page is an odd page or an even page and insert the correct
      translation code. Also, as before, we must be careful about inserting grestores
      before subsequent pages and before the <b>%%Trailer</b> or <b>%%EOF</b>
      comments.</p>

    <p>Here is the <acronym>PERL</acronym> script to do the job:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$flag = 0;                      # We have not yet found a page
$even = 0;                      # First page is an odd page
$page = 1;                      # Start at page #1
$pages = 1;                     # Allow %%Pages comment
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    if (/^%%Pages:/ &amp;&amp; $pages) {
        print &quot;%%Pages: (atend)\n&quot;;
        $pages = 0;
    } elsif (/^%%Page:/) {      # We have found a page
        if ($flag) {
            print &quot;restore\n&quot;;  # restore if it isn't the first
        }
        $flag = 1;
        if ($even) {            # Translate for even pages
            print &quot;save\n&quot;;     # gsave
            print &quot;504 426 translate\n&quot;;
            $even = 0;
            $page++;
        } else {                # Translate for odd pages
            printf(&quot;%%%%Page: %d %d\n&quot;, $page, $page);
            print &quot;save /showpage {} def\n&quot;;
            print &quot;504 30 translate\n&quot;;
            $even = 1;
        }                       # Code to rotate and shrink
        print &quot;90 rotate .5 .5 scale\n&quot;;
    } elsif (/^%%Trail/) {      # Cleanup if a %%Trailer is found
        if ($flag) {
            print &quot;restore\n&quot;;
        }
        print $_;
        printf(&quot;%%%%Pages: %d\n&quot;, $page);
        $flag = 0;
    } elsif (/^%%EOF/) {        # Cleanup if an %%EOF is found
        if ($flag) {
            print &quot;restore\n&quot;;
        }
        print $_;
        $flag = 0;
    } else {
        print;
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>Note the basic similarity with the script for the galley proofs. There
      are some additions, however. Because we are taking two pages and printing
      them on one page, we need to modify the page numbers. The <b>%%Pages:</b>
      comment specifies how many pages are in the document. If you specify &quot;%%Pages:
      (atend)&quot;, you are specifying that you do not know the exact number
      of pages, but you will give the information later.</p>

    <p>An additional complication is the use of <a href="operators.html#save">save</a>
      and <a href="operators.html#restore">restore</a> rather than <a href="operators.html#gsave">gsave</a>
      <a href="operators.html#grestore">grestore</a>. These operators save the
      <em>entire</em> state of the printer and restore it just as gsave and grestore
      work with the <em>graphics</em> state. In fact, an implicit gsave is done
      by save; and an implicit grestore is done by restore. The reason these
      are used is so that I can redefine <a href="operators.html#showpage">showpage</a>
      to a do-nothing procedure (<code>/showpage {} def</code>) for the odd pages.
      This trick prevents the page from being ejected when the odd page does
      its end of page routines. Unfortunately, this trick only works if the document
      calls showpage by name. If the document bound showpage up or calls some
      of the lower level operators, this program would need to be more sophisticated.</p>
