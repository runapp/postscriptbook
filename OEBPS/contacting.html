    <p>If you wish to contact me with a question, comment, or uncontrollable
      adulation, please feel free to e-mail me. My address is
      <a href="mailme.html">pjw@tailrecursive.org</a>.
      I recommend that you check the <a href="faq.html"><acronym>FAQ</acronym></a>
      first, however,
      since I have listed answers for many of the common questions I've received.
      I must also warn you not to expect a quick answer. I do not check my e-mail
      with notable frequency, so it may be a while before I see your message.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    
    <p>I was a graduate student at Indiana University in lovely Bloomington, Indiana.
      While there, I learned to love the closure and learned to hate the PDP-8 (well, not
      really).</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I am wasting my talents as a software developer for a certain large
      company in California you've all heard about and generally discovering to my horror
      that Dilbert is 100% accurate. Still, as a compensation, I get to live on the Pacific
      Rim.</p>
