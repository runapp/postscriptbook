    <p>In recent years, color printers have become more common... to
      the point where it is almost impossible to buy a black-and-white
      printer. Fortunately, PostScript handles color documents quite
      easily, and you do not have to learn much to add color to your
      documents.</p>

    <p>There are many, many ways to specify color. The science of
      color reproduction and perception is very complex and
      encompasses physics, chemistry, physiology, and psychology. PostScript
      provides a great deal of flexibility on this front, providing
      several different methods for specifying color to let you get as
      close as possible to the color you want specifying it in the way
      that is most natural in your application. I will discuss
      only two methods here, however, because&mdash;frankly&mdash;I
      know as much about color as a bee knows about ancient Phoenician.</p>

    <h2><acronym>RGB</acronym></h2>

    <p>The first method I will mention is the
      so-called <acronym>RGB</acronym> colorspace. In this model, you
      specify the red, green, and blue components of the color you want
      to reproduce. This is model specifies color using the additive
      primaries and will be very familiar to those who work with
      monitors and computer graphics.</p>

    <p>To specify a color using the <acronym>RGB</acronym> color
      space, you can use the <a href="operators.html#setrgbcolor">setrgbcolor</a>
      operator. This operator takes three operands: the red, green, and
      blue components of the color you want (0 means none, 1 means
      maximum). For example, to specify red, you can write <code>1 0 0
      setrgbcolor</code>; and to get a dark yellow, you can
      write <code>0.5 0 0.5 setrgbcolor</code>. Black is <code>0 0 0
      setrgbcolor</code>, and white is <code>1 1 1 setrgbcolor</code>.</p>

    <h2><acronym>CMYK</acronym></h2>

    <p>Another way to specify color is
      through the <acronym>CMYK</acronym> colorspace. In this model,
      you specify color using the subtractive primaries more common in
      the printing world: cyan, magenta, and yellow. To the primaries,
      a black component is added, to allow you to control the tone of
      the color (this is not necessary in the <acronym>RGB</acronym>
      model, since you are controlling the intensity of the light
      inherently).</p>

    <p>To specify a color using the <acronym>CYMK</acronym> color
      space, you can use the <a href="operators.html#setcymkcolor">setcymkcolor</a>
      operator. This operator takes four operands: the cyan, yellow,
      magenta, and black components of the color you want (0 means none, 1 means
      maximum). For example, to specify red, you can write <code>0 1 1
      0 setcymkcolor</code>; and to get a dark yellow, you can
      write <code>0 1 0 0.5 setcymkcolor</code>.</p>

    <p>One convenient property of PostScript is that color is handled
      as a property of the ink in the graphics state just like the
      gray level. In fact, the gray level set by setgray is really
      just color. What this means is that you can set the color of a
      line, or the color of a fill in exactly the same way as you set
      the gray level. You just call the operator before you stroke the
      line or fill the path. You can even use it to set the color of
      text by calling the appropriate operator before you call show.</p>

    <p>Since color works in such a similar way to the setgray
      operator, I am providing you with a
      complete <a href="examples/color.html">example</a>, but I
      will not break it down here.</p>

    <h2>A Warning</h2>

    <p>I have really simplified things considerably in this
      discussion. There are more than just two color spaces in
      PostScript, and there are several features in PostScript to
      allow for accurate color rendition. One thing that I&rsquo;ve
      glossed over is that different devices reproduce color with
      different degrees of accuracy (and different pigments not only
      have different color-accuracy but will vary over time). Another
      thing that I have glossed over is the fact that these two
      models are focused around color reproduction: it is also
      possible to specify color based on how it is perceived.</p>

    <p>If you do not care about color reproduction to that level of
      precision, then you do not need to worry about it. The color
      operators I have described are sufficient. If you do, you know
      far more about the matter than I do and will likely find the
      features you need described in
      the <acronym><a href="books.html#redbook">PLRM</a></acronym>.</p>
