    <h1><a name="text">Putting Text on the Page</a></h1>

    <div class="navbar">

    <p>Printing text on a page is, understandably, a simple process. It consists
      basically of these main steps:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set up a font to use </li>

      <li>Set the current point to where the lower left corner of the text will be </li>

      <li>Give the string to print to the <a href="operators.html#show">show</a> operator</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The show operator is the basic operator for printing strings of text.
      It takes a string and prints it out in the current font and with the lower
      left corner at the current point. After the text has been printed, the
      current point is at the lower right of the string.</p>

    <h2><a name="fonts">Fonts</a></h2>

    <p>Fonts in PostScript are actually <a href="language.html#dictionary">dictionaries</a>.
      A font dictionary contains several operators. Most of these operators simply
      set up the path for a single character in the font. When PostScript needs
      to typeset an &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the current font, it finds the operator specified
      in the font for &ldquo;A&rdquo; and invokes it. This operator goes about the business
      of drawing the letter. This means that there is no fundamental difference
      between letters and any other kind of ink on the page: text <em>is</em> graphics.
      Furthermore, since a font is essentially just a program to draw things,
      the current graphics state applies to text just as much as it applies to
      lines and curves which your program draws. This is one of the most powerful
      features of PostScript, as we will see later.</p>

    <p>The fonts themselves are stored in a special dictionary of fonts, and
      they are named. If you want to retrieve a font by name, you need to use
      the <a href="operators.html#findfont">findfont</a> operator. findfont
      retrieves the font from the dictionary (if it is there) and leaves the
      font on the stack. You can then specify how big the font should be and
      make it the current font. The basic process for setting the font is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Retrieve the font from the dictionary with findfont,</li>

      <li>Set the size of the font with <a href="operators.html#scalefont">scalefont</a>,</li>

      <li>Make this new font the current font with <a href="operators.html#setfont">setfont</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>scalefont takes two arguments, the lower argument on the stack is a
      font dictionary while the second is the size of the new font in points.
      scalefont returns a new font dictionary which is the same as the old one
      but scaled to the given size. setfont, on the other hand, takes a font
      dictionary and makes it the current font.</p>

    <p>For example, let us say that we want to start typesetting in Times Roman,
      and we want it to be set to 20 points. The following code would set up
      the correct font:</p>

<pre>
/Times-Roman findfont   % Get the basic font
20 scalefont            % Scale the font to 20 points
setfont                 % Make it the current font
</pre>

    <p>Since the font &ldquo;Times-Roman&rdquo; is stored in a dictionary, we
      search for it using its PostScript <a href="language.html#name">name</a>.
      Your printer will usually come with a set of built in fonts and will almost
      always allow you to add more. The names of the fonts available will vary
      from printer to printer, but Times is almost always present. Fonts typically
      come in families. &ldquo;Times&rdquo; is the name of the family we used here,
      and it has four member fonts: Times-Roman, Times-Italic, Time-Bold, and
      Times-BoldItalic.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="show">Showing Text</a></h2>
    
    <p>The <a href="operators.html#show">show</a> operator is used
      to typeset text on the page. It takes a single argument: a string containing
      the text to be typeset. Text can be considered to be part of the path,
      so you must also have set the current point with call to moveto or an equivalent
      operator. A typical call to show might look like this:</p>

<pre>
        newpath                 % Start a new path
        72 72 moveto            % Lower left corner of text at (72, 72)
        (Hello, world!) show    % Typeset &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
</pre>

    <p>If we ran this code right after the font selection code above, we would
      get the string &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; printed an inch in from the lower
      left corner, and it would be printed in 20 point Times-Roman. You can actually
      try this <a href="examples/hello-text.html">example</a>.</p>
