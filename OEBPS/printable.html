<H1>A Printable Version of this Guide</H1>

<P>Many people have asked for a printable version of this guide. I used
a program called <TT>HTML2LaTeX</TT> to convert the HTML files of this
guide into LaTeX, which I used to generate the necessary PostScript file.
Unfortunately, several people have had trouble with the PostScript generated
by our printing software. Therefore, I am providing both the PostScript
and the DVI file for the guide. If you have trouble with the PostScript
code, you may want to run the DVI file through the TeX utilities available
to you (if you don't have TeX, you can get a hold of DVI utilties on the
net which will allow you to print the file out).</P>

<P>In addition, this guide now has a number of European readers, so I am
providing the file formatted for A4 paper as well as the US Letter standard.</P>
