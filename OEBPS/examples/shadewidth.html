% Demonstrate shading and width in drawing lines and filling shapes

% Define an operator box which builds a path for a one inch square box
% Note that box does not draw or fill the box.

    <p>If you try this example, you should note a couple of things. Firstly,
      the black outlined box is a little larger than the gray filled one. This
      extra width comes from the 3 point wide lines used to draw it&mdash;they are
      <em>centered</em> about the path of the box. The ink filling the gray box,
      however, is completely within the path of the box. Also, when shading objects,
      you must be careful. PostScript makes shades through a process called halftoning.
      Basically, uniform dots are placed in various patterns to simulate different
      shades of grey. Unfortunately, various considerations limit how many shades
      a printer can produce. So some grey tones may come out the same. This may
      be the case with the filled box and the outlined box when viewed on your
      screen or printer.</p>
