It      differs from the previous editions in that a number of errors which people      have brought to my attention have been fixed and a number of common reader      <a href="faq.html">questions</a> have been addressed. I have also      added some information on how to work with colors and raster graphics. It is my hope      that this document is now stable and reasonably error-free. If you find an      error, please send me <a href="contacting.html">e-mail</a> and let me know.      I can&rsquo;t promise that I&rsquo;ll fix it right away, but I will at least add it to      my list of things to do.</p>    <p>My sincere thanks goes out to everyone who has sent me e-mail      concerning the guide. Whether you were asking a question, or      offering me a correction, I sincerely appreciate it. My only regret      is that I have not been able to be as responsive to questions and      corrections as I would like.</p>    <p>I left Indiana University quite a long time ago (nearly ten years      as of the time of this writing), and while I still have write access      to my old account space I can not be sure that I always will have      access. I will maintain the original copy at Indiana University      while I have access, but from now on the      <a href="http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/postscript.html">official copy</a>       will be maintained at my      personal <a href="http://www.tailrecursive.org">website</a>, where      you can also find out a <em>little</em> more about me, if you are so inclined.</p>    <h2><a name="about">About this Document</a></h2>        <p>This is meant to be a simple introduction to programming in the      <a href="postscript.html#note" name="16">PostScript</a>      page description language from <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>.      This document is      not meant to be a comprehensive reference manual (although it does contain      an <a href="operators.html#opindex" name="1">index</a> of some of PostScript&rsquo;s      standard operators and a list of various <a href="errors.html" name="3">errors</a>).      There are far better reference <a href="books.html" name="2">books</a>, if      this is what you need. Instead, this is meant as an easily accessible on-line      tutorial. It was written with the assumption that you have some experience      programming and are familiar with concepts like arrays and variables.</p>    <p>The scope of this document is fairly limited. I cover only a subset of      PostScript Level 1 (the earliest version). Since I started this guide, Adobe      brought out two revisions to the language: called Level 2 and Level 3.      This document was never meant to cover these versions of PostScript      (although the code I present here should run just fine on a Level 2 or Level      3 capable printer). Likewise, I do not cover any advanced printing concepts      like color separations or halftone screens (this is mainly due to ignorance      on my part, I am an engineer... not a printer or graphic designer... although      I do admire good graphic design when I see it).</p>    <p>I have created this document because I have noticed that many people on      the Internet have been asking for some online document to get them started.      I decided that this was a good opportunity. I have benefited from the free      and open nature of the Internet (most of the software I use is freeware or      shareware). This is my opportunity to give something back to the community      and to try to perpetuate something of the original community atmosphere that      existed when I first started using it.</p>    <h2>Contents</h2>    <ul>      <li><a href="what-is-it.html">What <i>is</i> PostScript?</a></li>      <li><a href="graphics.html">Graphics Concepts in PostScript</a></li>      <li><a href="language.html">Language Concepts in PostScript</a></li>      <li><a href="programming.html">Programming in PostScript</a></li>      <li><a href="drawing.html">Drawing and Filling Shapes</a> </li>      <li><a href="text.html">Putting Text on the Page</a></li>      <li><a href="color.html">Adding Color</a></li>      <li><a href="transforms.html">Transformations</a></li>      <li><a href="clipping.html">Clipping for Effect</a></li>      <li><a href="image.html">Raster Graphics</a></li>      <li><a href="eps.html">Encapsulated PostScript</a></li>      <li><a href="postprocess.html">Funky Stuff</a></li>      <li><a href="examples.html">Index of Examples</a></li>      <li><a href="operators.html#opindex">Index of Operators</a></li>      <li><a href="errors.html">Listing of Errors</a></li>      <li><a href="postscript.tar.gz">TAR Archive of These Pages</a></li>    </ul>        <h2><a name="note">Note</a></h2>        <p>PostScript is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.
