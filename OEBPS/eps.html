    <h2><a name="whatisit">What is Encapsulated PostScript?</a></h2>

    <p>At some point, you may want to include some nice PostScript image into
      a document. There are a number of problems associated with this, but the
      main one is that your page layout program needs to know how big the image
      is, and how to move it to the correct place on the page. Encapsulated PostScript
      (<acronym>EPS</acronym>) is that part of Adobe&rsquo;s Document Structuring Convention that provides
      this information.</p>

    <h2><a name="whatisdsc">What Is the Document Structuring Convention?</a></h2>
    
    <p>The <acronym>DSC</acronym> is a special file format for PostScript documents. The full
      details for the <acronym>DSC</acronym> can (and should) be gotten from Adobe. If you are writing
      a PostScript printer driver or other utility which will be used by a large
      number of people to create or manipulate PostScript documents, do not even
      think about writing it without making it <acronym>DSC</acronym>-compliant. You will save yourself
      and your users a lot of headaches.</p>

    <p>Although the full <acronym>DSC</acronym> is beyond the scope of this guide, the most basic
      rules can be explained. A <acronym>DSC</acronym>-compliant document is an ordinary PostScript
      document with a number of comments added. These comments provide information
      to any post-processors which work with the files. Some comments strictly
      provide information, others are used to structure the document into sections,
      which may be shuffled or processed in other ways by the post-processor.</p>

    <p>Every <acronym>DSC</acronym>-compliant document is indicated by having the comment <code>%!PS-Adobe
	3.0</code> as the first line. This comment is a flag to indicate that the
      document is compliant. You should never use this comment unless your document
      really is <acronym>DSC</acronym> compliant. There are many other parts to proper <acronym>DSC</acronym>. A document
      which follows the <acronym>DSC</acronym> can be manipulated in many ways. In particular, post-processors
      can shuffle the pages, print two or more pages on a side, and so on. The
      printer drivers from some notable companies do not follow the <acronym>DSC</acronym>, and
      their PostScript documents are, therefore, impossible to work with once
      they&rsquo;ve been generated.</p>

    <h2><a name="whatabouteps">Now, What About <acronym>EPS</acronym>?</a></h2>

    <p>An <acronym>EPS</acronym> file is a PostScript file which follows the <acronym>DSC</acronym> and which follows
      a couple of other rules. These rules can be summarized as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first line must be <code>%!PS-Adobe EPSF-3.0</code></li>
      
      <li>The file must make use of the BoundingBox comment</li>
      
      <li>The file should be a single page image (in <acronym>DSC</acronym> terms, the <code>%%Pages</code>
	comment must have a value of 0 or 1).</li>

      <li>The file should not use any <a href="verbotten.html">operators</a>
	which affect the global state.</li>

      <li>Finally, the <acronym>EPS</acronym> file should not use <a href="operators.html#showpage">showpage</a>.
	Actually, Adobe says that it is fine to use showpage in your <acronym>EPS</acronym> files.
	Officially, it is the responsibility of the importing application to redefine
	showpage so that the <acronym>EPS</acronym> file does not actually eject the page. Still,
	in creating <acronym>EPS</acronym> files, it would be wise not to use this operator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="boundingbox">BoundingBox</a></h2>
    
    <p>The BoundingBox comment is used in <acronym>DSC</acronym> to indicate where the actual
      image will be on a page. The comment describes a rectangle which completely
      encloses the image. The form of the comment is: <b>%%BoundingBox:</b> <i>llx</i>
      <i>lly</i> <i>urx</i> <i>ury</i>. For instance, suppose I have an image
      which extends from <i>x</i>=72 to <i>x</i>=144 and from <i>y</i>=150 to
      <i>y</i>=170. The BoundingBox comment in the document should then be: <code>%%BoundingBox:
	72 150 144 170</code>.</p>
