    <p>I have received a number of questions from readers, and many of them
      are the same. Since these seem to be popular questions, I thought I would
      list them here, along with my usual answers. Of course, you will also find
      the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.postscript.html"><acronym>FAQ</acronym></a>
      for the comp.lang.postscript Usenet group to be useful. There are far more
      <acronym>FAQ</acronym>s in that list than are here. By the
      way, if anyone knows of a better answer to any of these question, let me
      <a href="contacting.html">know</a>.</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="conversion">Is there a utility to convert a PostScript
	file into my favorite word processors format?</a></p>
    
    <p>Short answer: no.</p>
    
    <p>Long answer: Maybe. There is a utility to convert PostScript files into
      ASCII files (it tries to extract the text), but it can not work on every
      PostScript file. The problem here is that PostScript is a full programming
      language, and there are many ways to accomplish a given thing. It would
      be next to impossible for a program to look at some piece of PostScript
      and decide what the contents are. It would be possible to write a program
      which would accept some subset of PostScript files and convert them to
      some useful format, but it would be difficult to write (and it could not
      handle all possible PostScript files).</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="nonpostscript"></a>I have a Hawat-Pickford
	520xz ink jet printer without PostScript, is there anyway I can print PostScript
	files on it?</p>

    <p>Yep. There are a number of PostScript interpreters which run on your
      computer and can print out PostScript files. There are versions of these
      kinds of utilities for the Mac and for DOS/Windows machines. I have never
      used one of these utilities, so I can not recommend any particular one.
      Go to your friendly neighborhood dealer or your favorite catalog to see
      what they have. There is a section in the PostScript <acronym>FAQ</acronym> on this issue.
      You may also want to have a look at
      <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">GhostScript</a>.
      GhostScript can print PostScript files on certain printers.</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="preview"></a>Can you point me to a good previewer
	for my computer?</p>

    <p>My first recommendation is <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">GhostScript</a>.
      Hey, it's free; and it does a good job. It is also able to convert PostScript files to a number
      of other graphics formats, so it can be handy there.
      There are also a number of commercial previewers. I have not used any of
      these commercial packages, so I can not recommend any of them in particular.</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="acrobat">Can you tell me X about Acrobat and <acronym>PDF</acronym> files?</a></p>
    
    <p>Nope. I don't know anything about Acrobat or <acronym>PDF</acronym> files. Check out the
      <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> website. You may find the information
      you need there.</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="print">How do I print out a PostScript file from my	computer?</a></p>

    <p>The procedures and tools vary, depending upon the machine. I'm going
      to assume that you have a PostScript enabled printer and either received
      or wrote the PostScript file (if you have the application that generated
      the file, you should just use your application's print command or menu).</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>DOS/PC</b></dt>

      <dd>Assuming your PostScript printer is on port LPT1: (it really doesn't
	matter), all you need to do is:</dd>

      <dd><code>COPY FILE.PS LPT1:</code></dd>

      <dd>where <code>FILE.PS</code> is whatever your file is.</dd>

      <dt><b>Mac OS X</b></dt>
      <dd>
	Mac OS X comes with a built-in utility to convert PostScript files to <acronym>PDF</acronym>.
	Just opening the PostScript file from the Finder is sufficient to start the conversion.
	If you want to print the file and you do not have a PostScript printer, you can just print
	the <acronym>PDF</acronym> file you got normally. If you do have a PostScript printer, you will
	probably have to follow the instructions for Unix below.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>UNIX and its cousins</b></dt>

      <dd>Depending upon your system, just printing the file as if it were a text
	file <i>should</i> send it to the printer correctly. Most UNIX systems
	are clever enough to recognize the PostScript file from the <code>%!</code>
	comment at the beginning of the file. For example, on a BSD system:</dd>

      <dd><code>lpr file.ps</code></dd>
      
      <dd>should do the trick.</dd>
    </dl>


    <p class="faq"><a name="toospecific">My company has an Acme Laz-o-Tron typesetter.
	We're having problems printing out a set of color separations for a <acronym>TIFF</acronym>
	photograph processed by FotoWerks Pro+. Why are the separations coming
	out wrong?</a></p>

    <p>Beats me.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid the basic fact of the matter is that I'm not very bright.
      Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm not very bright. I also don't know a heck of a lot
      (you know, there's a joke: a dog, sitting in front of a computer says to
      his doggy friend, &ldquo;You know, on the Internet, no one knows you're
      a dog...&rdquo; for &ldquo;a dog&rdquo; substitute &ldquo;not an expert,&rdquo;
      and you've got something). I do know a fair amount about PostScript. Despite
      my deep and abiding love for fine typography, however, and despite the
      fact that ink runs in my blood, I don't know much about the printing industry
      or of the equipment they use.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about your software or your printer, I recommend
      contacting the manufacturer or a posting a question to a newsgroup (if
      there is a relevant one). I just do not know the particulars on different
      printers or software (unless it's something I own or use).</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="tobuyornot">I'm looking at two printers, one has PostScript
	while the other does not. Which should I buy?</a></p>

    <p>This is a common and very good question (there is a related one on whether
      or not to buy a PostScript extension for an existing printer). The answer,
      as it usually does, boils down to a definite, &ldquo;It depends.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If your main printing task consists of printing the monthly report or
      letters to clients, friends, family members, or whomever, then you will
      probably find PostScript to be an extravagance. This is especially true
      if you have no interest in mucking about with fonts or graphics. In other
      words, for light-duty, mainly text, print once and send to whomever kind
      of work, the answer is, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you are a desktop publisher, you are writing a book and want to send
      the book to your publisher electronically, or you do a lot of graphics
      work and want the graphics to look good regardless of the printer, the
      answer is yes. In all of these cases, you have a complex printing task
      and may want to proof your document at home or in the office but then send
      it out for final (higher quality) printing. Generally speaking, the same
      PostScript file will look the same regardless of which PostScript printer
      you use, with one exception: if one printer is capable of better print
      quality (finer lines, smoother curves, gentler shades of grey) than the
      other, your document should benefit from these increased capabilities without
      the PostScript file's needing to be changed. You are benefiting from PostScript's
      device independence.</p>

    <p>As for graphics intensive work, I find the <acronym>EPS</acronym> format to be the best
      for line drawing type graphics (<i>i.e.</i> no bitmap images) that I will
      want to include in a document. I very often want to print an image generated
      by one package when the word processor may be from a different vendor.
      Many times (incredible to tell) I sometimes need to include a graphic made
      on one computer system in a document on a completely different system!
      In such a heterogeneous environment, <acronym>EPS</acronym> graphics are just about the only
      reasonable option. Also, many top-quality drafting/painting programs generate
      their best output in <acronym>EPS</acronym> (on some windowing systems, the built-in graphic
      format can have a limited resolution that results in badly displaced elements
      in a printed image). If you use <acronym>EPS</acronym> graphics, you <i>must</i> have a PostScript
      enabled printer if you want to print them out with any quality at all.</p>

    <p>As with most things in our complex universe, it all depends upon what
      you are going to do. You must sit down and evaluate your needs and probable
      work habits. If you think you will benefit from PostScript's unique characteristics
      enough to justify the cost, then go for it.</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="concat" />Is it possible to concatenate two PostScript files together into a single file?</p>

    <p>Yes and no. If you do not care about
    being <acronym>DSC</acronym> compliant, then all you have to do is
    to slap the two files together into one. If that does not work,
    you could wrap each in a save/restore pair:</p>

<pre>
%!
save
  % contents of the first file
restore
save
  % contents of the second file
restore
</pre>

    <p>The problem with this approach is that it is not compliant with
      the <acronym>DSC</acronym>, so you can not do anything with the
      concatenated file. Previewers and print spoolers will have
      problems recognizing pages and would not be able to shuffle them
      appropriately. Other post-processing engines would fail to work
      with them too (for instance, you would not be able to display
      the file in <a href="nup.html">two up</a> format.</p>

    <p>If the two PostScript files are <acronym>DSC</acronym>
      compliant, came from the same tool, and use the same
      resources (the acid test is if they
      have the same preamble... the definitions at the start of the file
      before you get to the first page), then you could concatenate the
      files by starting with the common preamble, followed by the pages
      of the first file, followed by the pages of the second file. You
      would have to recognize the pages by looking at the page comments
      much like we did in the post-processing examples.</p>

    <p>You can not play this trick with files from different tools (or
      with different preambles). The problem is that a page in a file
      depends upon the definitions in the preamble, if you miss a
      definition, or if two files have different definitions for the
      same name, you really can not concatenate the files and keep the
      result compliant with the <acronym>DSC</acronym>.</p>
    
    <p>There are various scripts available out there to do the
      concatenation under these restrictions. Look around for tools
      like &ldquo;psmerge,&rdquo; &ldquo;psconcat,&rdquo; and the
      like, and see what might work for you (psmerge is part of the
      psutils package and is available on many Unix work-alikes, and
      comes bundled with Mac OS X).</p>

    <p class="faq"><a name="ps2pdf" />Is it possible to create a <acronym>PDF</acronym> from a PostScript file?</p>

    <p>Yes. <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">GhostScript</a>
      comes with a utility called ps2pdf which will do the job. Also,
      Mac OS X has the ability built-in: just double-click on the
      PostScript file in the Finder, and it will convert the file
      to <acronym>PDF</acronym> for you and give you an option to save
      the results. I&rsquo;m sure there are other tools to do the job, too.</p>

    <p class="faq">Is it true that you are one of the most stunningly attractive men on the net?</p>
    
    <p>Why, yes. How did you know?</p>
    
    <p>Okay, so maybe no one has ever asked me that. It was worth a shot. Maybe
      you wouldn't have noticed.</p>
