    <h2><a name="principles">Principles</a></h2>

    <p>The main purpose of PostScript is to draw graphics on the page. One
      of the elegant aspects of PostScript is that even text is a kind of graphic.
      The main task that must be mastered, then, is constructing paths which
      may be used to create the image. </p>

    <p>To draw and fill shapes, the basic sequence is: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start the path with the <a href="operators.html#newpath" name="4">newpath</a>
	operator.</li>
  
      <li>Construct the path out of line segments and curves (the path need not
	be contiguous).</li>

      <li>Draw the path with the <a href="operators.html#stroke">stroke</a>
	operator or fill it in with the <a href="operators.html#fill">fill</a>
	operator.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This basic sequence can be modified to do more complicated things as
      we will see later.</p>

    <h2><a name="drawbox">Drawing a Box</a></h2>

    <p>In this first example, we will draw a square inch box toward the lower
      left corner of the page. We start off by defining a function to convert
      inches into PostScript's main unit, the point (a point is defined in PostScript
      as 1/72th of an inch, which is slightly shorter than a true printer&rsquo;s point of 1/72.27 inch).
      The conversion is simple, we just multiply the number
      of inches by 72. This gives us the function</p>

    <pre>/inch {72 mul} def</pre>
    
    <p>To actually draw the square, we start a new path and move the current
      point to a point an inch in from both margins. This is accomplished with
      the code:</p>
    
<pre>
newpath
1 inch 1 inch moveto
</pre>
    
    <p>At this point, the path contains only the point (72, 72). We add in
      line segments leading away from this point with the <a href="operators.html#lineto">lineto</a>
      operator. This operator adds a line segment from the current point to the
      point specified to lineto and makes that point the new current point. We
      can build three sides of the box as follows:</p>
    
<pre>
2 inch 1 inch lineto
2 inch 2 inch lineto
1 inch 2 inch lineto
</pre>
    
    <p>We can add the last line by telling PostScript to close up the path
      with the smallest possible line segment. The <a href="operators.html#closepath">closepath</a>
      operator does this. This operator is especially useful if you need a closed
      figure for filling. Once we have closed the path, we can draw it with the
      stroke operator. We finish off the example by ejecting the page (if you
      are using a printer). PostScript ejects a page with the <a href="operators.html#showpage">showpage</a>
      operator:</p>

<pre>
closepath
stroke
showpage
</pre>

    <p>You can view and try the <a href="examples/box1.html">complete example</a>, if you like.</p>

    <h2><a name="refinements">Refinements</a></h2>

    <p>The lineto operator works in absolute coordinates within user space.
      That is, <code>72 72 lineto</code> adds a line segment from the current point
      to the point (72, 72) in user space. In drawing the box, however, it is
      more convenient to ignore the absolute coordinates of the box's vertexes
      and think instead of the lengths and directions of its sides. Fortunately,
      PostScript provides a version of lineto which takes <em>relative</em> coordinates
      instead. This is the <a href="operators.html#rlineto">rlineto</a>
      operator. rlineto adds the coordinates given as operands to the coordinates
      of the current point in the path to find the destination point. That is,
      <code>10 20 rlineto</code> will draw a line from the current point to a point
      10 points to the right and 20 points toward the top of the page. This is
      in contrast to <code>10 20 lineto</code> which adds a line segment which <em>always</em>
      ends at (10, 20). </p>

    <p>To see how we can use rlineto, let's replace the lineto lines in the
      last example with the following code:</p>

<pre>
1 inch 0 inch rlineto
0 inch 1 inch rlineto
-1 inch 0 inch rlineto
</pre>

    <p>This <a href="examples/box2.html">new example</a> will draw
      the same figure, but it draws the lines using relative coordinates instead
      of absolute. This makes it a little easier to visualize and has the added
      benefit that the same code can draw the three lines at a different location.
      Note that a negative relative <i>x</i> coordinate moves the point in the
      left direction while a negative relative <i>y</i> coordinate moves the
      point down the page.</p>

    <h2><a name="filling">Filling Shapes</a></h2>

    <p>Filling a shape is just as easy as drawing it. You create the path using
      the standard path creation operators, but instead of calling stroke at
      the end, you invoke the <a href="operators.html#fill">fill</a>
      operator. The fill operator will fill the path with the current ink settings.
      If you want to fill a shape with a pattern, you will need to do some special
      tricks which we will cover later. We will use the box from above as an
      <a href="examples/fill-box.html">example</a>, but we replace
      the original invocation of stroke with fill.</p>
    
    <p>Fill uses a simple winding rule (which is described in the <i><a href="books.html#redbook">Programming
	  Language Reference Manual</a></i>) to determine what parts of the page
      are inside or outside the path. The regions that are inside are painted.
      Note that arbitrarily complex shapes can be filled with this operator so
      long as you have enough memory on your PostScript interpreter. You can
      easily fill in different shades and even some patterns, but to fill an
      area with a complex image takes some special effects which we will cover
      later.</p>

    <h2><a name="shadeandwidth">Shading and Width</a></h2>
    
    <p>In PostScript, you can view lines as being drawn by pens that have a
      given width and ink as having particular shades. You are not restricted
      to completely black ink and one-point wide lines. PostScript provides two
      handy operators to change these characteristics. </p>

    <p>The <a href="operators.html#setgray">setgray</a> operator
      sets the intensity of the ink used in drawing lines and filling shapes
      (actually, setgray affects all subsequent markings made on the page). setgray
      takes a single numerical argument between 0 and 1. &ldquo;0&rdquo; signifies black,
      and &ldquo;1&rdquo; signifies white. Numbers between these two values signify various
      shades of gray.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="operators.html#setlinewidth">setlinewidth</a>
      operator does just what its name suggests: it sets the width of lines
      to be drawn. It takes a single numerical argument which is the width of
      the line in points. setlinewidth affects all lines <em>stroked</em> after
      the operator is invoked.</p>

    <p>Both of these operators affect the markings placed on the page after
      they are called... they do not effect the path until it is stroked or filled.
      In particular, you can not set the width or gray level for one part of
      the path and then change it for another... they are the same for all parts
      of the path, since it is stroked or filled only once. Also, both of these
      operators affect part of the graphics state and can be saved with <a href="operators.html#gsave">gsave</a>
      and restored with <a href="operators.html#grestore">grestore</a>.</p>

    <p>I have worked up an <a href="examples/shadewidth.html">example</a>
      using both these operators. I also demonstrate how you can use gsave and
      grestore to control the graphics state.</p>
