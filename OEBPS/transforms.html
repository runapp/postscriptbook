    <p>The PostScript interpreter keeps track of a matrix called the <a href="graphics.html#ctm">current
	transformation matrix</a>. When constructing an image, the interpreter
      uses this matrix to convert the world coordinates used by the program into
      device coordinates used by the printer itself. Generally, the actual contents
      of the matrix are of little interest to a well-written PostScript program;
      the reason for this is that the specific contents are device-dependent.
      A program that uses them might not work properly. PostScript does provide
      a number of operators, however, that transform the matrix in a device-independent
      way. These operators allow you to transform the way user space maps onto
      device space, and they modify the current transformation matrix with a
      simple matrix transformation. The basic transformation operators are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="operators.html#rotate">rotate</a> </li>

      <li><a href="operators.html#translate">translate</a> </li>
      
      <li><a href="operators.html#scale">scale</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is useful to realize that the current transformation matrix (and,
      hence the effect of all these operators) is part of the current graphics
      state and can be saved and restored using the <a href="operators.html#gsave">gsave</a>,
      and <a href="operators.html#grestore">grestore</a> operators.
      In addition, the transformations on the matrix affect path components constructed
      <em>after</em> the transformation. Even if a path is only partially constructed
      when a transformation is invoked, the parts of the path that were in place
      before the transformation will be unaffected. </p>

    <h2><a name="rotate">Rotate</a></h2>

    <p>The rotate operator takes a single, numerical operand. This operand
      specifies how many degrees to rotate the user space around its origin (positive
      values specify counter clockwise rotations). This transform allows you
      to do some pretty neat tricks. For example, let&rsquo;s say you have written
      a routine to draw some complex shape; and you have found that you need
      to draw it several times at different angles. In a more primitive graphics
      system, you might need to re-write to routine to take an angle as an argument,
      but in PostScript you only need to rotate the coordinates with the rotate
      operator.</p>
    
    <p>As a concrete <a href="examples/rotate.html">example</a>,
      let&rsquo;s say you want to draw lines in a circular pattern so that each line
      is ten degrees from its neighbors. Rather than figure out the coordinates
      for each of the 36 lines, we can just draw a horizontal line and rotate
      it repeatedly to different angles. To do the repeated looping, we can use
      the <a href="operators.html#for">for</a> operator. The for operator
      takes four arguments: an initial index value, a step size, a final index
      value, and a procedure. The operator increments an index from the initial
      value to the final value, incrementing it by the step size. For each index
      value, for will push the index on the stack and execute the procedure.
      This gives you a simple means of looping.</p>

    <p>We start by setting up the for loop. At the beginning of the loop&rsquo;s
      procedure, we start a new path and save the graphics state. </p>

<pre>
        0 10 360 {              % Go from 0 to 360 degrees in 10 degree steps
          newpath               % Start a new path
          gsave                 % Keep rotations temporary
</pre>

    <p>We next set the start of the line to (144, 144) and rotate the coordinates,
      we do not rotate <em>before</em> moving because (144, 144) would then be
      in a different location.</p>

<pre>
            144 144 moveto
            rotate              % Rotate by degrees on stack from 'for'
</pre>

    <p>We next draw just a horizontal line:</p>

<pre>
            72 0 rlineto
            stroke
</pre>

    <p>Finally, we restore the old graphics state and end the loop.</p>

<pre>
          grestore              % Get back the unrotated state
        } for                   % Iterate over angles
</pre>

    <h2><a name="translate">Translate</a></h2>

    <p>The translate operator takes two operands: an <i>x</i>-coordinate, and
      a <i>y</i>-coordinate. The translate operator sets the origin of user space
      to the point that was at the given coordinates in user space. The main
      use of the translate is to draw copies of a shape in different locations.
      Typically, a shape will be constructed at the origin, and the shape will
      be translated to the correct location before it is to be drawn. A simple
      <a href="examples/translate.html">example</a> translates a box
      constructed at the origin to the point (72, 72) in the original user space.</p>

    <h2><a name="scale">Scale</a></h2>

    <p>The scale operator takes two arguments: an <i>x</i> scale factor, and
      a <i>y</i> scale factor. The operator scales each coordinate by its associated
      scale factor. That is, if you have an <i>x</i> scale factor of 0.5 and
      a <i>y</i> scale factor of 3, the <i>x</i> coordinate will be reduced by
      a factor of two while the <i>y</i> coordinate will be magnified by a factor
      of 3. This operator allows you to change the size and dimensions of objects
      quite easily.</p>

    <p>A simple <a href="examples/scale.html">example</a> can just
      scale text in a couple of ways: We can make things narrow:</p>

<pre>
        gsave
          72 72 moveto
          0.5 1 scale           % Make the text narrow
          (Narrow Text) show    % Draw it
        grestore
</pre>

    <p>We can make things tall:</p>

<pre>
        gsave
          72 144 moveto
          1 2 scale             % Make the text tall
          (Tall Text) show      % Draw it
        grestore
</pre>

    <p>We can distort the text completely:</p>

<pre>
        gsave
          72 216 moveto
          2 0.5 scale           % Make the text wide and short
          (Squeezed Text) show  % Draw it
        grestore
</pre>

    <h2><a name="combinations">Combining Transformations</a></h2>

    <p>Each of these transformations merely modifies the current transformation
      matrix. This means that these operators can be combined for some interesting
      effects. For example, you can take a normal document and print two of its
      pages on a single page (reduced and placed side-by-side) simply by translating
      the first page to one side, rotating the page by ninety degrees and then
      reducing the page so that it fits. The second page is handled in the same
      manner, but is translated to the other side of the page. This can be easily
      done by PostScript post-processors so long as they know where one page ends
      and the next begins (this is often accomplished using special
      <a href="language.html#comment">comments</a>).
      A somewhat simpler <a href="examples/transform.html">example</a>
      is to draw a simple box and some text translated, rotated, and scaled in
      various ways. An important thing to remember when viewing this example
      is that translations are always relative to the <em>current user space</em>.
      This means that</p>

<pre>
        0.5 0.5 scale
        72 72 translate
</pre>

    <p>will have a different effect on the image than does</p>

<pre>
        72 72 translate
        0.5 0.5 scale
</pre>

    <p>In the first case, the origin will be half an inch in from the bottom
      and left margins. In the second case, the origin will be an inch in from
      the two margins.</p>
