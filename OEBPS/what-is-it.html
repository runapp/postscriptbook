    <p>PostScript is a programming language optimized for printing graphics
      and text (whether on paper, film, or <acronym>CRT</acronym> is immaterial). In the jargon
      of the day, it is a <b>page description language</b>. It was introduced
      by Adobe in 1985 and first (to my knowledge) appeared in the Apple LaserWriter.
      The main purpose of PostScript was to provide a convenient language in
      which to describe images in a device independent manner. This device independence
      means that the image is described without reference to any specific device
      features (<i>e.g.</i> printer resolution) so that the same description
      could be used on any PostScript printer (say, a LaserWriter or a Linotron)
      without modification. In practice, some PostScript files do make assumptions
      about the target device (such as its resolution or the number of paper
      trays it has), but this is bad practice and limits portability.</p>
    
    <p>The language itself, which is typically interpreted, is stack-based
      in the same manner as an <acronym>RPN</acronym> calculator. A program pushes arguments for
      an operator onto a stack and then invokes the operator. Typically, the
      operator will have some result which is left at the top of the stack. As
      an example, let us say we want to multiply 12 and 134. We would use the
      following PostScript code:</p>
    
    <pre>12 134 mul</pre>
    
    <p>The first two words &ldquo;12&rdquo; and &ldquo;134&rdquo; push the numbers 12 and 134 onto
      the stack. <a href="operators.html#mul">&ldquo;mul&rdquo;</a> invokes the
      multiply operator which pops two values off the stack, multiplies them,
      and then pushes the result back onto the stack. The resulting value can
      be left there to be used by another operator later in the program. </p>
    
    <p>To follow the conventions used by Adobe in their manuals, I will synopsize
      operators using the following scheme: <i>arg-1</i> <i>arg-2</i> ... <b>operator</b>
      <i>result</i>. This scheme means that, to use <b>operator</b>, you must
      push arguments <i>arg-1</i>, <i>arg-2</i>, and so on before invoking the
      operator. <b>operator</b> will return the result: <i>result</i>. Many operators
      return no result (they have some side-effect); these will be shown as returning
      &ldquo;<b>-</b>&rdquo;.</p>
