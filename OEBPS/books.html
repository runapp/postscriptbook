    <p>There are a number of good books on PostScript. If you do much PostScript
      programming at all, I highly recommend that you get one of these print
      books.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a name="redbook"></a><i>PostScript Language Reference Manual: Third
	  Edition</i></dt>
      
      <dd>This book is put out by Adobe Systems Incorporated and is published
	by Addison Wesley. It is <i>the</i> reference manual and pretty much defines
	the language. The operator reference guide I have here pretty well follows
	Adobe's reference in this manual. Their reference is, however, far more
	detailed (and accurate). This book is known as the &ldquo;Red and White
	Book.&rdquo; Adobe also provides other books (including the &ldquo;Blue&rdquo;
	tutorial and cookbook). The <i>PLRM</i>'s ISBN is: 0-201-37922-8</dd>

      <dt><a name="bluebook"></a><i>PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook</i></dt>

      <dd>This book is also put out by Adobe and is published by Addison Wesley.
	(Are you starting to see a pattern here?) This is a very neat book on PostScript
	and gives a number of handy examples (two which come to mind are a set
	of routines to set text in a circle and a simple text formatter). This
	is the so-called blue book. The ISBN is 0-201-10179-3.</dd>
      
      <dt><a name="visual"></a><i>Learning PostScript: a Visual Approach</i></dt>
      
      <dd>This book is a fine beginning text for PostScript. The book emphasizes
	PostScript's fantastic graphics abilities while illustrating basic language
	constructs. The language concepts are illustrated with graphic design examples,
	most of which you will be tempted to use in your own documents. The book
	also includes a number of interesting and useful utilities. Author: Ross
	Smith. Publisher: Peachpit Press. ISBN 0-938-151-12-6. I do
	not know if this book is still in print, but there are copies
	available on Amazon at the time I write this. You can probably
	find it elsewhere, too.</dd>
