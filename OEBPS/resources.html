    <p>There are numerous sources of information on PostScript, both print
      and available over the web. This is only a small list of some of the things
      you may find of interest. Note, remember that the web is a disorganized
      beast, these sites and resources may or may not be accessible at the moment.
      Please let me know if they vanish or if you find something interesting
      that you think should be added here.</p>

      <dd>There are a number of previewers available for different platforms.
	Many of them are commercial packages, but there is one which runs on most
	platforms which is freely available. It is the GhostScript previewer (which
	is part of the GNU project). GhostScript is available from many FTP sites
	(just about anywhere you can find GNU programs). There is a <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">web
	  site</a> dedicated to GhostScript, however, which may be more convenient.</dd>
